# microui-quickdraw
expiremental - mostly function quickdraw (classic macintosh) implementation for immediate mode microUI (https://github.com/rxi/microui)

-- too slow to be used on 8MHz 68000-based Macs, maybe fast enough for slightly faster machines
-- still a bit buggy (abandoned when speed issues were noticed
